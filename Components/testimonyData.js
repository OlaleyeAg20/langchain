        testimony: "Before GiftChain.ai, I had to write the gifts in a book by hand. Now, simply spin up a child-specific smart contract, authorize my Elf Wallet with a 12-step SantaMask authentication, mint a behavior-driven NFT for each gift, wrap it in an IBFS hash, and sign the transaction with my cold storage Elf Vault.",

        testimony: "Managing the naughty and nice lists used to be time consuming. With GiftChain.ai, I just deploy a NaughtyScore™ oracle, validate behavior logs with ZK-Snark proofs, stake my HolidayTokens for consensus, and broadcast the finalized list to the ElfNet™ blockchain. Simple, huh?!",
